# Trust and Reputation System Design

## Overview

This document defines a comprehensive trust and reputation system for the decentralized URL metadata network. The system enables users to build reputation through accurate contributions, establish explicit trust relationships, and filter content based on personalized trust networks.

The trust system addresses the fundamental challenge: **anyone can post metadata about any URL, but not all metadata is equally reliable**. Without trust signals, the system would be vulnerable to spam, manipulation, and false information.

## 1. Trust Model Design

### 1.1 Trust Signal Types

The system supports multiple types of trust signals between users:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

### 1.2 Explicit Trust Declarations

Users can explicitly declare trust levels for other users:

#### Trust Levels
| Level | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `full-trust` | 1.0 | Complete trust - treat their content as highly reliable |
| `trust` | 0.7 | General trust - weight their contributions positively |
| `neutral` | 0.0 | No explicit position - rely on computed reputation |
| `skeptical` | -0.3 | Mild distrust - weight their contributions down |
| `distrust` | -0.7 | Strong distrust - significantly discount their content |
| `block` | -1.0 | Complete distrust - exclude from all calculations |

#### Domain-Specific Trust

Trust can be scoped to specific domains/topics:

```
User A trusts User B:
├── Overall: 0.7 (general trust)
├── Domain "science": 0.9 (high expertise trust)
├── Domain "politics": 0.3 (limited trust)
└── Domain "economics": null (no specific trust, uses overall)
```

**Standard Domain Categories:**
- `science` - Scientific claims, research interpretation
- `politics` - Political statements, policy claims
- `economics` - Economic data, market claims
- `technology` - Technical accuracy, product claims
- `health` - Medical/health information
- `history` - Historical facts and context
- `legal` - Legal interpretations and claims
- `media` - Media analysis, journalism quality
- `local-{region}` - Regional/local knowledge
- `industry-{sector}` - Industry-specific expertise

### 1.3 Trust Decay Functions

Trust signals and reputation decay over time to ensure:
- Recent behavior is weighted more heavily
- Inactive users don't maintain unearned reputation
- The system adapts to changing user behavior

#### Time-Based Decay Function

```
decay(t) = e^(-λ * t)

where:
  t = time since event (in days)
  λ = decay rate constant
```

**Decay Rate Constants by Signal Type:**

| Signal Type | λ (decay rate) | Half-life | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Explicit trust declaration | 0.001 | ~693 days | Trust relationships are stable |
| Individual rating accuracy | 0.005 | ~139 days | Recent accuracy matters more |
| Fact-check validation | 0.003 | ~231 days | Fact-checks have lasting value |
| Endorsement | 0.002 | ~347 days | Endorsements remain relevant |
| Activity signal | 0.01 | ~69 days | Activity should be recent |

#### Decay Implementation

```python
import math
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def calculate_decayed_weight(
    original_weight: float,
    event_timestamp: int,
    current_timestamp: int,
    decay_rate: float
) -> float:
    """Calculate weight with time decay applied."""
    days_elapsed = (current_timestamp - event_timestamp) / 86400
    decay_factor = math.exp(-decay_rate * days_elapsed)
    return original_weight * decay_factor

def aggregate_with_decay(
    signals: list[dict],
    decay_rate: float,
    current_time: int
) -> float:
    """Aggregate multiple signals with time decay."""
    total_weight = 0.0
    weighted_sum = 0.0
    
    for signal in signals:
        decayed_weight = calculate_decayed_weight(
            signal['weight'],
            signal['timestamp'],
            current_time,
            decay_rate
        )
        weighted_sum += signal['value'] * decayed_weight
        total_weight += decayed_weight
    
    if total_weight == 0:
        return 0.0
    return weighted_sum / total_weight
```

### 1.4 Negative Trust (Distrust) Model

Negative trust requires careful handling to prevent abuse while enabling legitimate warnings:

#### Distrust Properties
1. **Asymmetric Impact**: Distrust should not cancel out trust from others
2. **Bounded Influence**: Single distrust declaration has limited effect
3. **Requires Justification**: Distrust events should include reasoning
4. **Auditable**: All distrust signals are public and contestable

#### Distrust Aggregation

```
effective_distrust(user) = max(
    aggregate_distrust * diminishing_factor,
    individual_distrust_cap
)

where:
  aggregate_distrust = sum of all distrust signals
  diminishing_factor = 1 / (1 + ln(1 + distrust_count))
  individual_distrust_cap = -0.5 (no single source can fully discredit)
```

This ensures:
- Multiple independent distrust signals have more impact
- Coordinated attacks have diminishing returns
- No single actor can destroy someone's reputation

## 2. Reputation Score Calculations

### 2.1 Multi-Dimensional Reputation Model

Reputation is calculated across multiple independent dimensions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    REPUTATION DIMENSIONS                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                     │
│   ACCURACY (weight: 0.30)                                           │
│   └── How often user's claims/ratings align with consensus          │
│                                                                     │
│   CONSISTENCY (weight: 0.15)                                        │
│   └── Stability of positions and methodology over time              │
│                                                                     │
│   EXPERTISE (weight: 0.20)                                          │
│   └── Demonstrated knowledge in specific domains                    │
│                                                                     │
│   PEER_RECOGNITION (weight: 0.20)                                   │
│   └── Endorsements and trust from other reputable users             │
│                                                                     │
│   SOURCE_QUALITY (weight: 0.10)                                     │
│   └── Quality and diversity of evidence cited                       │
│                                                                     │
│   ACTIVITY (weight: 0.05)                                           │
│   └── Engagement level and contribution frequency                   │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Reputation Score Formula

#### Overall Reputation Score

```
R(user) = Σ(wi * Di(user) * decay_factor_i)

where:
  R(user) = overall reputation score [0, 10]
  wi = weight for dimension i
  Di(user) = normalized score for dimension i [0, 10]
  decay_factor_i = time-based decay for dimension i
```

#### Dimension Calculations

**Accuracy Score (D_accuracy):**
```
D_accuracy = 10 * (validated_correct / total_validatable)

where:
  validated_correct = number of ratings/fact-checks that matched 
                      eventual consensus
  total_validatable = number of ratings/fact-checks that have been
                      independently validated
```

**Consistency Score (D_consistency):**
```
D_consistency = 10 * (1 - variance(position_shifts))

where:
  position_shifts = significant changes in stance on similar topics
  variance is normalized to [0, 1]
```

**Expertise Score (D_expertise):**
```
D_expertise(domain) = 10 * sigmoid(
    α * log(domain_contributions + 1) +
    β * domain_accuracy +
    γ * expert_endorsements
)

where:
  α, β, γ = tunable parameters
  sigmoid normalizes to [0, 10]
```

**Peer Recognition Score (D_peer):**
```
D_peer = 10 * Σ(endorser_reputation * endorsement_weight * decay) / max_possible

where:
  endorser_reputation = reputation of person giving endorsement
  endorsement_weight = strength of endorsement [0, 1]
  decay = time decay factor
  max_possible = theoretical maximum endorsement score
```

**Source Quality Score (D_source):**
```
D_source = 10 * (
    0.4 * primary_source_ratio +
    0.3 * source_diversity_score +
    0.3 * avg_source_reputation
)
```

**Activity Score (D_activity):**
```
D_activity = 10 * min(1.0, recent_contributions / activity_threshold)

where:
  recent_contributions = contributions in last 90 days
  activity_threshold = baseline expected activity (e.g., 10 contributions)
```

### 2.3 Domain-Specific Reputation

Each user has separate reputation scores per domain:

```python
class UserReputation:
    overall: float  # [0, 10]
    domains: dict[str, DomainReputation]
    
class DomainReputation:
    score: float  # [0, 10]
    contributions: int
    accuracy_rate: float
    last_active: int  # timestamp
    endorsements: list[Endorsement]
    expertise_level: str  # novice, intermediate, expert, authority
```

**Expertise Level Thresholds:**
| Level | Score | Contributions | Requirements |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Novice | 0-3 | < 5 | New to domain |
| Intermediate | 3-6 | 5-20 | Consistent participation |
| Expert | 6-8 | 20-50 | High accuracy, peer recognition |
| Authority | 8-10 | 50+ | Top accuracy, multiple expert endorsements |

### 2.4 Cold Start Problem Solutions

New users face the "cold start" problem - they have no reputation history. The system addresses this through multiple mechanisms:

#### Strategy 1: Bootstrapping from NOSTR Identity

```python
def bootstrap_reputation(pubkey: str) -> float:
    """Calculate initial reputation from existing NOSTR presence."""
    
    # Check for NIP-05 verification
    nip05_bonus = 0.5 if has_nip05_verification(pubkey) else 0
    
    # Check account age
    age_days = get_account_age_days(pubkey)
    age_score = min(1.0, age_days / 365) * 0.5
    
    # Check existing social graph
    follower_count = get_follower_count(pubkey)
    social_score = min(1.0, math.log(follower_count + 1) / 10) * 0.5
    
    # Check if endorsed by known experts
    expert_endorsements = get_endorsements_from_experts(pubkey)
    endorsement_score = min(1.0, len(expert_endorsements) * 0.2) * 1.0
    
    base_reputation = 3.0  # Starting point
    bonus = nip05_bonus + age_score + social_score + endorsement_score
    
    return min(5.0, base_reputation + bonus)  # Cap at 5 for new users
```

#### Strategy 2: Provisional Trust Period

New users enter a "provisional" period:

```
Provisional Period Rules:
├── Duration: First 30 days OR first 10 contributions
├── Visibility: Content marked as "from new contributor"
├── Weight: Contributions weighted at 50% in aggregations
├── Verification: More stringent source requirements
└── Graduation: Automatic upon completing period with good standing
```

#### Strategy 3: Vouching System

Established users can vouch for new users:

```
Vouch Properties:
├── Voucher must have reputation ≥ 6.0
├── Voucher stakes portion of their reputation
├── Vouch provides immediate reputation boost (up to +2.0)
├── If new user behaves badly, voucher loses reputation
└── Maximum 3 active vouches per voucher
```

#### Strategy 4: Gradual Trust Unlocking

```
Trust Level Progression:
├── Level 0 (New): Can only react, view content
├── Level 1 (10 contributions): Can rate content
├── Level 2 (25 contributions): Can create annotations
├── Level 3 (50 contributions): Can create fact-checks
├── Level 4 (100 contributions): Can endorse others
└── Level 5 (Authority): Full system access
```

### 2.5 Reputation Change Mechanics

Reputation changes based on outcomes:

#### Positive Reputation Events

| Event | Impact | Conditions |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Rating matches consensus | +0.05 to accuracy | ≥10 other ratings agreeing |
| Fact-check validated | +0.2 to accuracy | Independent verification |
| Endorsement received | +0.1 to peer score | From user with rep ≥ 6 |
| Expert endorsement | +0.3 to domain expertise | From domain authority |
| Quality contribution | +0.05 to source score | High source quality rating |

#### Negative Reputation Events

| Event | Impact | Conditions |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Rating contradicts consensus | -0.03 to accuracy | ≥10 others disagreeing |
| Fact-check disputed (lost) | -0.15 to accuracy | Dispute resolved against |
| Content flagged as spam | -0.5 overall | Community consensus |
| Coordinated manipulation | -2.0 overall | Detected by anti-abuse |
| Distrust from trusted user | -0.1 to peer score | From user with rep ≥ 7 |

#### Reputation Bounds

```
Reputation Constraints:
├── Minimum: 0.0 (complete loss of standing)
├── Maximum: 10.0 (theoretical perfect reputation)
├── Rate limiting: Max ±1.0 change per day
├── Floor protection: Cannot drop below 2.0 from single event
└── Recovery rate: Minimum +0.01/day if actively contributing positively
```

---

## 3. Web of Trust Implementation

### 3.1 Trust Graph Model

The trust network forms a directed weighted graph:

```
G = (V, E, W)

where:
  V = set of users (NOSTR pubkeys)
  E = set of directed trust relationships (trustor → trustee)
  W: E → [-1, 1] = edge weights (trust levels)
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User A<br/>Rep: 8.5] -->|0.9| B[User B<br/>Rep: 7.2]
    A -->|0.7| C[User C<br/>Rep: 6.8]
    B -->|0.8| D[User D<br/>Rep: 7.5]
    B -->|-0.3| E[User E<br/>Rep: 4.2]
    C -->|0.6| D
    C -->|0.5| F[User F<br/>Rep: 5.9]
    D -->|0.7| G[User G<br/>Rep: 6.5]
    
    style A fill:#4CAF50
    style E fill:#f44336
```

### 3.2 Transitive Trust Calculation

Trust propagates through the network with diminishing strength:

#### Basic Transitive Trust

```
T(A→C via B) = T(A→B) × T(B→C) × propagation_factor

where:
  T(X→Y) = direct trust from X to Y
  propagation_factor = 0.7 (trust diminishes at each hop)
```

#### Multi-Path Trust Aggregation

When multiple paths exist between users:

```python
def calculate_transitive_trust(
    graph: TrustGraph,
    source: str,
    target: str,
    max_depth: int = 3
) -> float:
    """Calculate trust from source to target through all paths."""
    
    all_paths = find_all_paths(graph, source, target, max_depth)
    
    if not all_paths:
        return 0.0  # No trust path exists
    
    path_trusts = []
    for path in all_paths:
        path_trust = 1.0
        for i in range(len(path) - 1):
            edge_trust = graph.get_trust(path[i], path[i+1])
            hop_factor = 0.7 ** i  # Diminishing with each hop
            path_trust *= edge_trust * hop_factor
        path_trusts.append(path_trust)
    
    # Aggregate using max + bonus for multiple paths
    max_trust = max(path_trusts)
    additional_paths_bonus = sum(
        t * 0.1 for t in sorted(path_trusts, reverse=True)[1:5]
    )
    
    return min(1.0, max_trust + additional_paths_bonus)
```

### 3.3 PageRank-Inspired Trust Algorithm

The system uses a modified PageRank algorithm for global trust scoring:

#### TrustRank Algorithm

```python
def calculate_trust_rank(
    graph: TrustGraph,
    seed_users: list[str],
    damping: float = 0.85,
    iterations: int = 50
) -> dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculate global trust scores using TrustRank algorithm.
    
    Args:
        graph: The trust relationship graph
        seed_users: Known trusted users (e.g., verified fact-checkers)
        damping: Probability of following trust links vs. random jump
        iterations: Number of iterations for convergence
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping pubkeys to trust scores
    """
    n = len(graph.nodes)
    
    # Initialize with seed trust
    trust = {node: 0.0 for node in graph.nodes}
    for seed in seed_users:
        trust[seed] = 1.0 / len(seed_users)
    
    # Iterate until convergence
    for _ in range(iterations):
        new_trust = {}
        
        for node in graph.nodes:
            # Trust from incoming edges
            incoming_trust = sum(
                trust[src] * graph.get_trust(src, node) / graph.out_degree(src)
                for src in graph.get_incoming(node)
                if graph.out_degree(src) > 0
            )
            
            # Apply damping factor
            new_trust[node] = (1 - damping) / n + damping * incoming_trust
        
        trust = new_trust
    
    # Normalize to [0, 10] scale
    max_trust = max(trust.values()) or 1.0
    return {k: v * 10 / max_trust for k, v in trust.items()}
```

### 3.4 Configurable Trust Depth

Users can configure how deep transitive trust propagates:

```
Trust Depth Settings:
├── Depth 0: Only explicit trust (users I directly trust)
├── Depth 1: +Friends of friends (default)
├── Depth 2: +Extended network
├── Depth 3: +Broad community
└── Unlimited: Full web of trust (not recommended)
```

#### Depth Impact on Weight

```
weight_at_depth(d) = base_weight × (0.7)^d

Example (base_weight = 1.0):
├── Depth 0: 1.0
├── Depth 1: 0.7
├── Depth 2: 0.49
└── Depth 3: 0.343
```

### 3.5 User-Controlled Trust Policies

Users can define custom trust policies:

```json
{
  "trust_policy": {
    "name": "My Trust Policy",
    "max_depth": 2,
    "minimum_reputation": 5.0,
    "require_nip05": true,
    "domain_overrides": {
      "science": {
        "max_depth": 3,
        "minimum_reputation": 7.0,
        "require_expert_status": true
      },
      "politics": {
        "max_depth": 1,
        "minimum_reputation": 6.0
      }
    },
    "blocked_users": ["pubkey1", "pubkey2"],
    "seed_users": ["trusted_expert_pubkey1"],
    "trust_decay_rate": 0.002,
    "distrust_propagation": false
  }
}
```

#### Policy Types

| Policy | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Conservative | Depth 1, high rep threshold | High-stakes decisions |
| Balanced | Depth 2, moderate threshold | General use (default) |
| Liberal | Depth 3, low threshold | Discovery, exploration |
| Expert-only | Depth 2, requires expertise | Domain-specific research |
| Custom | User-defined parameters | Advanced users |

---

## 4. Weighted Content Display

### 4.1 Rating Aggregation Algorithm

When multiple users rate the same URL, the system aggregates their ratings:

#### Weighted Average with Reputation

```python
def aggregate_ratings(
    ratings: list[Rating],
    viewer_pubkey: str,
    trust_graph: TrustGraph
) -> AggregatedRating:
    """
    Aggregate multiple ratings weighted by trust and reputation.
    """
    if not ratings:
        return None
    
    weights = []
    values_by_dimension = defaultdict(list)
    
    for rating in ratings:
        # Calculate weight from multiple factors
        author_rep = get_reputation(rating.author)
        trust_level = get_trust_level(viewer_pubkey, rating.author, trust_graph)
        time_decay = calculate_decay(rating.created_at)
        
        # Combine factors
        weight = (

        sample_size=len(ratings),
        total_weight=sum(weights),
        confidence=confidence
    )
```

### 4.2 Weighting by Author Reputation

The weight formula for individual contributions:

```
W(contribution) = R_author × T_viewer→author × D_time × Q_content

where:
  R_author = normalized reputation score [0, 1]
  T_viewer→author = trust level (direct or transitive) [0, 1]
  D_time = time decay factor [0, 1]
  Q_content = content quality signals [0.5, 1.5]
```

#### Content Quality Multipliers

| Quality Signal | Multiplier Range |
|----------------|------------------|
| Has citations | 1.0 - 1.3 |
| Detailed reasoning | 1.0 - 1.2 |
| Primary sources | 1.1 - 1.4 |
| Peer-reviewed sources | 1.2 - 1.5 |
| No sources | 0.6 - 0.8 |
| Flagged content | 0.3 - 0.5 |

### 4.3 Handling Conflicting Fact-Checks

When multiple fact-checks conflict, the system uses sophisticated resolution:

#### Conflict Detection

```python
def detect_conflicts(fact_checks: list[FactCheck]) -> list[ConflictGroup]:
    """Group fact-checks by conflicting verdicts."""
    
    verdict_groups = defaultdict(list)
    for fc in fact_checks:
        verdict_groups[fc.verdict].append(fc)
    
    if len(verdict_groups) <= 1:
        return []  # No conflict
    
    conflicts = []
    for verdict_a, group_a in verdict_groups.items():
        for verdict_b, group_b in verdict_groups.items():
            if verdict_a < verdict_b and are_contradictory(verdict_a, verdict_b):
                conflicts.append(ConflictGroup(
                    verdict_a=verdict_a,
                    group_a=group_a,
                    verdict_b=verdict_b,
                    group_b=group_b
                ))
    
    return conflicts
```

#### Conflict Resolution Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Conflicting Fact-Checks Detected] --> B{Clear Reputation Winner?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Weight by Total Reputation]
    B -->|No| D{Expert vs Non-Expert?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Prefer Domain Experts]
    D -->|No| F{Evidence Quality Difference?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Prefer Better Evidence]
    F -->|No| H{Temporal Difference?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Prefer More Recent]
    H -->|No| J[Display Both with Context]
    
    C --> K[Show Weighted Consensus]
    E --> K
    G --> K
    I --> K
    J --> L[Show Disputed Status]
```

#### Resolution Scoring

```python
def resolve_conflict(conflict: ConflictGroup, viewer: str) -> ResolutionResult:
    """Resolve a conflict between fact-check groups."""
    
    def score_group(group: list[FactCheck]) -> float:
        return sum(
            get_fact_check_weight(fc, viewer)
            for fc in group
        )
    
    score_a = score_group(conflict.group_a)
    score_b = score_group(conflict.group_b)
    
    total = score_a + score_b
    if total == 0:
        return ResolutionResult(status='undetermined')
    
    ratio = max(score_a, score_b) / total
    
    if ratio > 0.75:  # Clear winner
        winner = conflict.verdict_a if score_a > score_b else conflict.verdict_b
        return ResolutionResult(
            status='resolved',
            verdict=winner,
            confidence=ratio,
            dissent_strength=1 - ratio
        )
    else:  # No clear consensus
        return ResolutionResult(
            status='disputed',
            primary_verdict=conflict.verdict_a if score_a > score_b else conflict.verdict_b,
            primary_support=ratio,
            alternative_verdict=conflict.verdict_b if score_a > score_b else conflict.verdict_a,
            alternative_support=1 - ratio
        )
```

### 4.4 Surfacing "Most Trusted" Content

The system provides multiple views of content based on trust:

#### Trust-Filtered Views

| View | Description | Algorithm |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Personal** | Your trust network only | Filter by trust_level > 0 |
| **Extended** | Your network + high-rep users | trust_level > 0 OR reputation > 7 |
| **Community** | Weighted community consensus | Full aggregation with weights |
| **Raw** | All content, equal weight | Unfiltered view |

#### Surfacing Algorithm

```python
def get_trusted_content_for_url(
    url: str,
    viewer: str,
    view_type: str = 'personal'
) -> TrustedContent:
    """Get content filtered and sorted by trust."""
    
    all_content = get_all_metadata_for_url(url)
    trust_graph = get_trust_graph(viewer)
    
    scored_content = []
    for item in all_content:
        # Calculate composite score
        author_rep = get_reputation(item.author)
        trust_level = get_trust_level(viewer, item.author, trust_graph)
        content_quality = assess_content_quality(item)
        engagement = get_engagement_score(item)
        
        composite_score = (
            trust_level * 0.4 +
            (author_rep / 10) * 0.3 +
            content_quality * 0.2 +
            engagement * 0.1
        )
        
        # Apply view filter
        if view_type == 'personal' and trust_level <= 0:
            continue
        if view_type == 'extended' and trust_level <= 0 and author_rep < 7:
            continue
        
        scored_content.append({
            'item': item,
            'score': composite_score,
            'trust_level': trust_level,
            'reputation': author_rep
        })
    
    # Sort by score
    scored_content.sort(key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
    
    return TrustedContent(
        items=scored_content,
        aggregated_rating=aggregate_ratings(
            [c['item'] for c in scored_content if c['item'].type == 'rating'],
            viewer,
            trust_graph
        )
    )
```

#### Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Proof of Work** | Require computational cost for account creation | Medium |
| **NIP-05 Verification** | Require domain-based identity | High |
| **Social Graph Analysis** | New accounts need trust from established users | High |
| **Rate Limiting** | Limit contributions per time window | Medium |
| **Stake-based Trust** | Require Lightning payment for elevated trust | Very High |
| **Vouching Cost** | Vouching for Sybils damages voucher reputation | High |

### 5.2 Reputation Bombing Prevention

Reputation bombing: coordinated negative attacks on legitimate users.

#### Detection Signals

```python
def detect_reputation_bombing(

### 7.3 Performance Considerations

#### Optimization Strategies

| Area | Strategy | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Trust Graph Loading | Lazy load, depth-limited | Reduces initial load time |
| Reputation Queries | Batch requests, cache aggressively | Reduces relay load |

## Summary

This trust and reputation system design provides:

### Core Capabilities

1. **Explicit Trust Signals** - Users can declare trust/distrust with domain specificity
2. **Multi-Dimensional Reputation** - Scores across accuracy, consistency, expertise, and peer recognition
3. **Web of Trust** - Transitive trust with configurable depth and policies
4. **Weighted Aggregation** - Content weighted by author reputation and viewer trust
5. **Anti-Abuse Protection** - Multiple layers of Sybil, spam, and attack resistance

### NOSTR Integration

- **6 new event kinds** (30382-30386) for trust-related data
- **NIP-51 integration** for trust lists
- Queryable with standard NOSTR filters
- Compatible with existing NOSTR infrastructure

### Key Design Principles

1. **User Control** - Users configure their own trust policies
2. **Transparency** - All calculations are auditable
3. **Decentralization** - No central authority required
4. **Graceful Degradation** - Works with partial data
5. **Attack Resistance** - Multiple defensive layers

### Next Steps for Implementation

1. Implement core trust event handling
2. Build client-side trust graph management
3. Deploy server-side TrustRank computation
4. Integrate with existing content aggregation
5. Add anti-abuse detection systems
6. Build user interfaces for trust management
